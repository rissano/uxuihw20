            <p>To ensure that Planify meets the needs of its users, extensive research was conducted involving user interviews, surveys, and competitor analysis. The primary goal was to understand the pain points and preferences of individuals when planning their travels. Key insights revealed that users often struggle with the overwhelming number of options and the time-consuming nature of trip planning. They expressed a desire for a streamlined process that offers personalized recommendations and simplifies the overall planning experience. This research informed the development of Planify, guiding the design of features aimed at addressing these specific user needs and enhancing the overall user experience.</p>

            <p>Through extensive research, it became evident that busy individuals face significant challenges when planning their trips. These challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overwhelming Options:</strong> Users are often overwhelmed by the sheer number of choices available for destinations, accommodations, and activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Time-Consuming Planning:</strong> The process of organizing a trip is time-consuming and stressful, making it difficult for users to balance with their work and personal lives.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Personalized Recommendations:</strong> Users struggle to find travel options tailored to their specific preferences and needs, leading to less satisfactory travel experiences.</li>

            <p>The prototyping phase for Planify involved creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes to design the app's interface and functionality. Initial sketches outlined the basic structure, which were then developed into digital wireframes. User feedback from usability testing led to several iterations, refining the design to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The high-fidelity prototypes closely resemble the final product, highlighting key features like personalized trip recommendations and a streamlined booking process.</p>

        <div class="tab-pane fade" id="testing" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="testing-tab">
            <p>During the testing phase, Planify was evaluated by 5 users to identify areas for improvement. Key tasks included creating an account, setting destination preferences, and navigating the explore page. Feedback highlighted the need for better visibility of tips and specific dates for trip recommendations. Iterations focused on enhancing user experience by addressing these issues, resulting in a more intuitive and functional app.</p>
